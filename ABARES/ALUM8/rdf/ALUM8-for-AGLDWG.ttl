Land in a rotation system should be classified according to the prime use (if known) or the land use at the time of mapping, with rotation information recorded in the management field. If the rotation sequence is known record this in the comments field.
Effort is made to distinguish between actual land use change and a rotation. For example, in Queensland, an area that is usually cropped but is not used for that particular purpose in the year mapped, is still mapped as cropping in an updated dataset and is not mapped as grazing until there is evidence of pasture or vegetation regrowth and/or cropping machinery would not easily pass over the land.
Cropping can vary markedly over relatively short distances in response to changes in the nature of the land and the preferences of the land manager. It may also change over time in response to market conditions. Production of fodder, such as lucerne hay, is considered cropping as there is no harvesting by stock. Strip cropping—where multiple commodities are cropped simultaneously—can be assigned to the secondary class 3.3 'Cropping' with multiple commodities recorded using the commodity field, and cropping strip in the management field. If irrigation infrastructure is present the relevant class should be applied under 4.3, ‘Irrigated cropping’ regardless of whether the crop was irrigated in the growing season.

  skos:definition """This class includes agricultural land uses where water is applied to promote additional growth over normally dry periods, depending on the season, water availability and commodity prices.
This includes land uses that receive only one or two irrigations per year, through to those uses that rely on irrigation for much of the growing season. Baxter and Russell (1994) created this primary class because of the degree of intervention involved in irrigation, and its potential impacts on hydrology and geohydrology.
Irrigation in Australia is in a state of flux and so there is a need to rely more heavily on ancillary data than in the past. These ancillary data sources may include proximity to water sources, information from water entitlements (irrigation licences), field survey and local knowledge. Due to seasonal or market conditions, land that is developed for irrigation might not always be actively irrigated. Land should be mapped according to prime use (if known), or use at the time of mapping, however it is suggested that areas be assigned to the irrigation classes if permanent infrastructure for irrigation is present. Effort should be made to distinguish between actual land use change and a rotation. For example, in Queensland, an area that is usually 4.3 ‘Irrigated cropping’ but is not used for that particular purpose in the year mapped, is still mapped as 4.3 ‘Irrigated cropping’ in an updated dataset and is not mapped as 4.2 ‘Grazing irrigated modified pastures’ until there is evidence of pasture or vegetation regrowth and/or cropping machinery would not easily pass over the land.
If there is no evidence of irrigation (infrastructure or active irrigation) then the area should be mapped to the appropriate dryland class. Particular crops, such as rice, may always be assumed to be irrigated.
Fallow or ploughed land should be assigned to the most likely land use based on the dominant activity conducted in comparable nearby areas. Fallow or ploughed land should be allocated to the relevant pasture, cropping or horticulture class (rather than using land in transition).

  skos:definition """Water features are regarded as essential to the ALUM Classification because of their importance for natural resources management, agricultural production and as points of reference in the landscape. At the secondary level, the classification identifies water features, both natural and artificial. Tertiary classes relate water features to intensity of use and conservation status.
Because water is a land cover rather than a land use, water classes may not be mutually exclusive with other land use classes at particular levels in the classification. Generally, water classes should take precedence so that, for example, a lake in a conservation reserve will be classed as 6.1 ‘Lake’ or 6.1.1 ‘Lake—conservation’, rather than as 1.1 ‘Nature conservation’. Water features where a conservation tertiary class applies may be attributed using the comments field. 
When mapping seasonal water features it is best to refer to ancillary datasets and, if still unsure map to the land use at the time. Notes about seasonal inundations can be included in the comments field."""@en ;
