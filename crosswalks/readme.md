# Crosswalks - ecosystems and landcover types

This folder contains crosswalks (mappings) between standard ecosystem and land cover type classifiers.

We expect to use [SSSOM](https://github.com/mapping-commons/SSSOM) and [XKOS](https://ddialliance.org/Specification/RDF/XKOS) to record the mappings and their provenance.
